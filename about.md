## Who am I?

Raritet is, for now at least, just me. So I'll proceed like this is a personal site.

By day I'm an electrical engineer that designs power and control systems for heavy movable structures, like drawbridges. (We call them generically "movable bridges," but that's the engineer in me talking.) By night, however, when I'm not flaking out dreaming about some future project I may or may not build, I try to quickly fabricate little prototypes exploring the intersection of art and engineering. Lest you think that I am some sort of highfalutin' engineer-philosopher, a lot of the projects are just for humor's sake as well.

I have been bad at documenting my work, so over the next few weeks and months I'll be updating this site with both old and new projects and ideas. I'll also migrate my old blog here---there's a lot of interesting stuff in there. It warrants [adding to your feedreader](http://raritet.github.io/atom.xml). I'll also try to post updates to more immediate media like Twitter and whatnot.

## Photography

I also like to take pictures. Photography is the other thing I do well besides engineering (though I hope I'm also a good thinker and designer, but I have more to show for it on the photography front). I have had some commissions, and I am available for more. Take a look at my [portfolio](http://www.andy-oliver.com) to see some of my work.

## What is a Raritet?

It means _rarity_ in Swedish, and in this context it's being used like _oddity_ or _curiosity_, as in a cabinet of curiosities. My step mother (really just one of my mothers---the modifier _step_ is irrelevant) is Swedish, though I have no other connection to Scandinavia other than the fact that I absolutely loved my [two](http://www.andy-oliver.com/southern-norway/) [trips](http://www.andy-oliver.com/tromsoe-norway/) to Norway and can't wait to go again.

## Music

At the risk of sounding like a jack of all trades and master of none, I also like music and make beats from time to time. I post them to [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/coherent-noise) when I do.

## Credits

This site uses the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) Jekyll theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). I set it up for the most part by simply forking Hyde into my Github Pages root. I also got some help from [this page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) (and others too numerous to mention).
